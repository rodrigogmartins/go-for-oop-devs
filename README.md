# GO for OOP Developers

If you come from an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) background, Go might initially feel minimalistic or even “too simple”.

You may look for familiar constructs like classes, inheritance, annotations, generics, or frameworks, and not find them the same way.

But Go is designed with clarity, simplicity, and explicitness in mind — trading some abstraction for ease of reasoning, concurrency, and performance.

This guide highlights the main paradigm shifts you’ll encounter and provides pro-tips for writing idiomatic Go code.

Go isn’t OOP — it’s **simple, pragmatic, and compositional**.

Embrace **structs, interfaces, and composition**, and you’ll write **cleaner, faster, and more maintainable** systems.
