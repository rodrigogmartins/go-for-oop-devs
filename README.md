# Go for OOP Developers

A practical guide for developers transitioning from **Object-Oriented Programming** (Java, C#, C++) to **Go**.

If you come from an OOP background, Go may initially feel minimalistic or even *too simple*.  
Concepts such as classes, inheritance hierarchies, annotations, and heavy frameworks are either absent or intentionally de-emphasized.

This is not a limitation.

Go is designed to optimize for **clarity, explicit behavior, concurrency, and predictable performance**, trading deep abstraction layers for simplicity and ease of reasoning.

This project explains the **key paradigm shifts** required to move from OOP-style thinking to Go’s **compositional and pragmatic design**.  
It focuses on:

- how Go differs conceptually from classic OOP
- common pitfalls for developers coming from Java-style architectures
- practical guidelines for writing idiomatic, maintainable Go code

Go is not an OOP language.  
It favors **structs, small interfaces, explicit dependencies, and composition** over inheritance and hidden behavior.

The documentation is written to be:

- easy to scan
- suitable for onboarding
- useful as a daily reference
