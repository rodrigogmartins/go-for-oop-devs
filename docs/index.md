# Go for OOP Developers

This documentation is a **practical introduction to Go** for developers coming from Object-Oriented languages such as **Java, C#, or C++**.

If your background is rooted in classical OOP, Go may initially feel *minimalistic*, *unopinionated*, or even *too simple*.\
Concepts like classes, inheritance hierarchies, annotations, heavy frameworks, or extensive abstraction layers are either absent or intentionally de-emphasized.

This is not a limitation — it is a **deliberate design choice**.

Go was created to optimize for:

- **Readability and clarity**
- **Explicit behavior over hidden magic**
- **Fast compilation and predictable performance**
- **Built-in concurrency as a first-class concern**
- **Maintainability at scale by teams, not individuals**

Instead of deep object hierarchies, Go favors:

- Composition over inheritance
- Small, focused interfaces
- Explicit dependencies
- Simple data structures and clear control flow

The goal of this guide is **not** to make you an expert in Go, but to help you:

- Adjust your mental model when coming from OOP
- Understand *why* Go works differently
- Avoid common anti-patterns brought from Java-style design
- Write code that feels idiomatic, readable, and maintainable in Go

Use this documentation as a **reference guide** and a **conceptual map** while transitioning to Go.
